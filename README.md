# InstallerTemplate
A template program to make installers for other programs. The main goal of this program is to allow me to have a template to make installers for other programs I make.
At the moment, it simply downloads one of my other repos releases and extracts it.

### Key features:
- Should work on multiple platforms if compiled for them
- VERY basic but functional GUI for the user, essentially foolproof!
- Default extraction location can be designated, and the user can see it, as well as modify it if they choose to.
