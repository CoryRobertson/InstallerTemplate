# InstallerTemplate
A template program to make installers for other programs. The main goal of this program is to allow me to have a tempalate to make installers for other programs I make.
At the moment, it simply downloads one of my other repos releases and extracts it, but a planned feature would be to also build the program from source if it uses a build tools that this program recognizes, e.g. gradle, cargo, etc.

### Key features:
- Should work on multiple platforms if compiled for them
- VERY basic but functional GUI for the user, essentially fool proof!
- Default extraction location can be designated, and the user can see it, as well as modify it if they choose to.
